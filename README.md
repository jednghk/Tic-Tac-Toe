# Tic Tac Toe

This project is self-explanatory, its a browser tic tac toe game

My primary focus for this project was to implement factory functions and the revealing module pattern in my code.

Prior to this project, all my variables had been defined in a global scope which eventually led to me having
to rephrase variable names so they didn't clash. However I still felt I don't have a grasp on how the revealing
module pattern should be implemented so I hope to revisit this in the future. Nonetheless, I'm quite proud
that I managed to organise my code in a relatively neat manner. I made sure every function had a "single resposibility"
so that any problems or bugs boiled down to one function scope.

However, there are some scopes that in hindsight could have been nested further and did not need to pollute
the top level scope. I also didn't need to store the board as an associative array, but a normal array would
have sufficed.

The primary challenge for this problem was organising the code in a comprehensive manner and fitting all the
functionality in logical places.
